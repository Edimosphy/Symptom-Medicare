# Symptom MediCare
## Project Overview -Symptom Medicare
This health-simulated demo project aims to tackle critical health challenges in World especially in Nigeria by providing a smarter way to diagnose diseases based on physical symptoms. It seeks to reduce misdiagnosis and the inappropriate use of antimalarial and antibiotic drugs by the public. By guiding healthcare workers toward more accurate assessments, it will ultimately lead to the earlier detection and diagnosis of diseases, ensuring patients receive the right treatment atÂ theÂ rightÂ time.

## Problems that project aim to address:

#### Symptom MediCare is designed to:
1. Reduce Misdiagnosis: By guiding healthcare workers toward more accurate assessments especially in the rural areas where there is inadequate medical facilities 
2. Prevent Drug Misuse: Ensuring people use the right medicine for the right illness, reducing inappropriate use of important drugs.
3. Enable Early Detection: Leading to earlier diagnosis, so patients receive the right treatment at the right time.

## Project Features:
1. Built using Streamlit, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn and probabilistic approaches called Naive Bayes.
2.  Visualizes probability distribution using bar chart
3.   Fully interactive UI with dropdown selectors
4.   Styled with a clean and emoji cues
##### Key Feature: Bar chart to visually show the probability distribution of the likely diseases. This would helps healthcare workers see not just one possible diagnosis, but the relative chances of different illnesses, aiding their decision-making.
##### For this demo, we're focusing on Nigeria's most common diseases: Malaria, Typhoid, and HIV/AIDS with ten(10) similar physical symptoms

## How it Works:
1. The app uses a Naive Bayes classifier trained on a small simulated dataset.
2. Users select symptoms such as Fever level, Fatigue, Vomiting, and more.
3. The algorithm then computes the most likely disease and shows a chart of probabilities.

## Result
### ðŸ“Š Result Output

After submitting your symptoms, the app shows:
- The most likely disease
- A probability chart comparing likelihoods for all diseases

## APP Deployment
This health simulated demo app will be depolyed on Streamlit
Here is the link of the app **https://symptom-medicare.streamlit.app/**

## Colab notelink Access

## Future plan, Innovation and Collaboration:
1. Advanced Machine Learning to build an even more robust AI model.
2. Introduce databases where vital user information like age, gender, and location can be securely stored. This data will be valuable for medical research and crucial for tracking disease outbreaks across Nigeria and the World at large


## Challenges
1. Limited Health database and medical resources for the Model training
